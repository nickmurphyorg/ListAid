I regularly use list apps for running errands and wanted to rethink the experience for managing lists. ListAid takes a visual, gesture driven approach to managing lists. This experience is made possible through the use of custom view controller transitions and gesture recognizers. I utilized Core Data for persisting the userâ€™s data.
